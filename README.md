# UT.6.10X-Embedded-Systems

  -  This repo contains my solutions to the Lab assignments/startercode of the UT.6.10X Embedded-Systems MOOC offered by 
University of Texas,Austin on Edx.org
  -  You will need KEIL uVision4 IDE to build/burn/run/debug the projects in this repo.
  -  You will also need the TeXas plugin for the simulator and grader.
  -  These projects are meant to be run on the EK-TM4C123GXL Microcontroller evaluation board by Texas Instruments.
  -  Lab2-Lab7 require only the eval board,and the rest require other electronics hardware like breadboards,resistors,LEDs,switches etc.
  -  Code files are writted in the C programming language and ARM assembly language.
